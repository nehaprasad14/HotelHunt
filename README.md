## (HOTEL RESERVATION SYSTEM)

‘Hotel Hunt’ is a servlet based web application that aims at providing users the ability to search, book rooms and packages for hotels based on various filters. One can search for and book various types of hotel room. The user can search based on various filters such as: hotel name, city, zip code, rating, price range, check-in or check-out date, and various amenities like disability care, gym, pool, etc. and package deals like hotel room in combination with flight or free local tour or car rental service.

This system does not only cater to a customer’s need but also provide a robust platform for Hotel manager and Staff to manage the system.

The system also provides the customers with the interesting feature for viewing ‘what’s trending’ such as Top 5 most liked hotels based on review rating, Top 5 most booked hotels by city and Top 5 zip code where maximum hotels booked. Also, the users can also match the deals with the competitors (via trends in Twitter) to provide and maintain the best deals in the market. In addition, the system also provides the get direction using google maps and chat bot feature for user assistance.
